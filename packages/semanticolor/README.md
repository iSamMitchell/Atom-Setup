# semanticolor

Semantic highlighting for almost any language in Atom. Colors are used to highlight the important parts of your program: the variables, methods, and classes.

For more about semantic highlighting, see the article [Coding in Color](https://medium.com/@evnbr/coding-in-color-3a6db2743a1e#.qpff7n7r6) by Evan Brooks.

By default, semanticolor also accentuates comments to make them stand out. This option can be turned off in the settings, but for the reasoning behind it, read [Your syntax highlighter is wrong](https://medium.com/@MrJamesFisher/your-syntax-highlighter-is-wrong-6f83add748c9#.a51p6whqc) by James Fisher.

* Works both dark and light themes.
* Settings to let you adjust how colors are generated and applied.

# language settings

These are the meanings of the available language options:

* contrast - make these elements stand out from the rest of the document
* mute - make these elements less prominent than the rest of the document
* colorize - colorize these elements using semanticolor
* theme - let the configured syntax theme determine the color for these elements
* defer - let other scopes for these elements determine the option to use
* default - use the option you set in your configured defaults
